This plugin offers you:

* **Increasing your authority**: Increase your authority by linking to most authoritative related posts (good for SEO).
* **Related Images**: Use related images right from the sidebar. Related images are free to use and proper credits are added by default.
* **Your own images**: Connect your Instagram & Flickr accounts and insert your images!

After Zemanta analyzes your post, a simple point and click interface allows you to easily insert related posts, related images, links and tags. By not having to search for related posts, you will save time and increase the efficiency of your editorial process.

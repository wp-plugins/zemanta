Zemanta adds a widget to your editor that finds related content to your blog post.

== Description ==

Zemanta provides **contextual content recommendations** to you while you write. It enhances your blog post with relevant images, videos, links, and SEO optimized tags. All recommended content is blogger friendly with clearly marked licenses (Creative Commons or similar).

A simple point and click interface allows you to add only recommendations that you like, without breaking the flow of writing your post. Complimentary content provides a better experience for your readers while giving you additional ideas on what to write about. Not having to search for related content saves you time and increases the overall efficiency of your editorial process.

The related articles feature allows you to link to trusted blog posts as well as your own content.

Amazon affiliate support allows you to quickly link to books, music CD's and DVD's and earn money in the process.

Zemanta brings you content from:

* **Reference guides**: Wikipedia, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Amazon, CrunchBase, ITIS, MusicBrainz, NCBI, Snooth Wines, Wikinvest
* **Videos**: YouTube, 5min
* **Images**: Getty images, Flickr, Wikimedia Commons

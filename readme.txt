This plugin finds related posts and related images while you write your post. Pick related posts manually!

== Description ==

Add **related posts** and related images to your blog. You save time, increase your SEO, and become a member of our network of over 120,000 bloggers!

* **Related posts** from your own blogs and the network. Related posts can have thumbnails too!
* **Increase your authority** by linking to the most authoritative related posts (good for SEO).
* **Related Images** added with a single click. Proper credits are added by default!
* **Link Love** by linking to other bloggers' related posts. In turn, we'll recommend your posts to other bloggers. Then find out how much love (links, tweets, likes) your posts received via Zemanta Dashboard.

After Zemanta analyzes your post, a point and click interface allows you to insert related posts and related images. By not having to search for related posts, you will save time and be more efficient.
